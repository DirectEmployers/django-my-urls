* Django MyUrls - A URL Shortner and click server
** URL Shortners:

1. Make it easier to share links in fewer characters. (short URLs or shorties)
   http://arinc.jobs/san-diego-ca/senior-electrical-engineer/19716289/job becomes something like  http://my.jobs/aU302q

2. Make it possible to track clicks on third party websites.

3. Make it possible to measure sharing of links.

** Click Servers:

1. Make it possible to track clicks from third party websites.

2. Make it possible to measure sharing of links

3. Obfuscating and hiding url content. Users see http://mysite.com/32kd. Clickers are redirected to http://contestwinner.com/you/win?utm_medium=web

** Django MyUrls serves both functions.

*** MYURLS_DEFAULT_REDIRECT = '301'

*** MYURLS_ALLOW_ALL_SITES
If you are using the django.contrib.sites framework, MyURLs can allow short urls to work on just the site linked with the myrl or all of your sites.
**** True: Short URLS will work on all sites.
**** False: Short URLS will only work on the site linked to the short URL.
*** MYURLS_USE_UTM (Google Analytics Integraton)
Activates appending UTM (Urchin Tracking Metrics) codes to urls. This allows Google Analytics to better categorize traffic that is referred via MyURLS. When set to True, the following settings should be configured:
**** MYURLS_DEFAULT_UTM_CAMPAIGN
**** MYURLS_DEFAULT_UTM_MEDIUM
**** MYURLS_DEFAULT_UTM_SOURCE
**** MYURLS_DEFAULT_UTM_CONTENT
** Using MyUrls 
Two methods are provided for implementing short URL redirection:
a 404 FallbackMiddleWare and a view. 
*** When to use the FallBackMiddleWare:
- When every URL except those in URLs.py are short URLs
- eg. mysite.com/si11S
*** When to use the view based redirector:
- When you need all URLs following a URL pattern to be redirected.
- eg. mysite.com/click/si11S
